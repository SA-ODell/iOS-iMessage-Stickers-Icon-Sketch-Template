# iOS10 iMessage Stickers Icon Template for Sketch

This is a simple Sketch template with designated Artboards for all the necessary icon sizes that Xcode requires for Stickers apps for iOS 10.

I've tried to label all the Artboards so that when exporting assets, the naming convention would make it super simple to match icons to Xcode.

## Tell me if you used this template to make your iMessage Stickers

I'll add it to this README to share with others.

### Format when creating issue

Title for the new issue should have `[Sticker pack]` then a hyphen and the name of your sticker pack.
